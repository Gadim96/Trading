# Scenario Risk Engine (C++)

A modular C++ risk engine that simulates yield curve scenarios and revalues fixed-income instruments such as bonds. Includes Xcode support and unit tests using Catch2.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

-  Modular C++ design (header/source split)
-  Interest rate scenario simulation
-  Pricing of zero-coupon bonds
-  Unit testing with Catch2
-  Cross-platform CMake build with Xcode support

---

##  Future Extensions

- Multi-curve interest rate models
- Additional instrument types (e.g., FRNs, swaps)
- Real market data integration
- Parallelized scenario generation

---

##  Notes

- I ran the project using Xcode. Simply add all files to a new Xcode project. It should compile and run without issues.
- To run the tests, switch the scheme to the `tests` target in Xcode.

##  Manual Build with CMake (Optional)

```bash
cd risk_engine_cpp
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/tests/test_simple
```
